"Pray sit down, Mr. Garth," continued the banker, in his suavest tone.</p><p>"I am glad that you arrived just in time to find me here. I know you count your minutes."</p><p>"Oh," said Caleb, gently, with a slow swing of his head on one side, as he seated himself and laid his hat on the floor.</p></div> </div>

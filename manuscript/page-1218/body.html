She was wishing it were possible to restore the times of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a strong desire to rescue him from his chance-gotten money.</p><p>"I don't pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic," said Lydgate.

Practically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an impatience of everything in which the parson doesn't cut the principal figure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good deal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people uncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!â€”he ought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the birds."</p></div> </div>

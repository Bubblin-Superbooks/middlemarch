<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">fine, religious, charitable uncle o' yours. Come now!" Here Mr. Featherstone had his peculiar inward shake which signified merriment.</p><p>"Mr. Bulstrode?"</p><p>"Who else, eh?"</p><p>"Then the story has grown into this lie out of some sermonizing words he may have let fall about me. Do they pretend that he named the man who lent me the money?"</p><p>"If there is such a man, depend upon it Bulstrode knows him. But, supposing you only tried to get the money lent, and didn't get itâ€”Bulstrode 'ud know that too. You bring me a writing from Bulstrode to say he doesn't believe you've ever promised to pay your debts out o' my land. Come now!"</p><p>Mr. Featherstone's face required its whole scale of grimaces as a muscular outlet to his silent triumph in the soundness of his faculties.</p></div> </div>

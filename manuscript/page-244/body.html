A woman must learn to put up with little things. You will be married some day."</p><p>"Not to any one who is like Fred."</p><p>"Don't decry your own brother, my dear. Few young men have less against them, although he couldn't take his degreeâ€”I'm sure I can't understand why, for he seems to me most clever. And you know yourself he was thought equal to the best society at college. So particular as you are, my dear, I wonder you are not glad to have such a gentlemanly young man for a brother. You are always finding fault with Bob because he is not Fred."</p><p>"Oh no, mamma, only because he is Bob."</p><p>"Well, my dear, you will not find any Middlemarch young man who has not something against him."</p></div> </div>

I cannot bear the smell of them all over the house at this hour of the morning."</p><p>"Oh, my dear, you are so hard on your brothers! It is the only fault I have to find with you. You are the sweetest temper in the world, but you are so tetchy with your brothers."</p><p>"Not tetchy, mamma: you never hear me speak in an unladylike way."</p><p>"Well, but you want to deny them things."</p></div> </div>

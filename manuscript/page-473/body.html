English ladies are not at everybody's service as models. And you want to express too much with your painting. You would only have made a better or worse portrait with a background which every connoisseur would give a different reason for or against. And what is a portrait of a woman? Your painting and Plastik are poor stuff after all. They perturb and dull conceptions instead of raising them. Language is a finer medium."</p><p>"Yes, for those who can't paint," said Naumann. "There you have perfect right. I did not recommend you to paint, my friend."</p></div> </div>

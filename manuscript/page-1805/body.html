Mrs. Casaubon was still undisciplined enough to burst into angry tears.</p><p>"Now, really, Dodo," said Celia, with rather a deeper guttural than usual, "you <em>are</em> contradictory: first one thing and then another. You used to submit to Mr. Casaubon quite shamefully: I think you would have given up ever coming to see me if he had asked you."</p><p>"Of course I submitted to him, because it was my duty; it was my feeling for him," said Dorothea, looking through the prism of her tears.</p><p>"Then why can't you think it your duty to submit a little to what James wishes?" said Celia, with a sense of stringency in her argument. "Because he only wishes what is for your own good. And, of course, men know best about everything, except what women know better." Dorothea laughed and forgot her tears.</p></div> </div>
